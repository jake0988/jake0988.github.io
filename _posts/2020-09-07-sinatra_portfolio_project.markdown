For my Sinatra Portfolio Project I created a MVC framework that I imagined would be used for students and administrators in the world of Harry Potter. There are four Houses that have many Students. The Houses have many CupWinners and a CupWinner belongs to a house. A Student has many CupWinners through StudentCupWinners and a Cup has many Students through StudentCupWinners.

The process took me a while, sorting through different privileges that a student, an administrator, and someone not logged in would have. These varying privileges caused many bugs in different views and routes. Working through the process with Tux, Shotgun, and Pry, was how I spent most of the time coding, especially after the skeleton of the app was formed. Starting out, I didn’t really know what I wanted to build, other than an app that met the requirements for the project. As I began working on it, and visualizing what scenario would need a signup and login that would also allow for some creativity in the way the app formed, I thought Harry Potter and Hogwarts would be a good place to look.

There were many things I learned on my journey through making this app. I feel I am fairly well grounded in at least the most basic aspects of Sinatra. I understand RESTFUL routes and CRUD, and feel fairly confident I could create another simple app reasonably quickly at this point. I didn’t delve to much into CSS for this project, and so if I were to spend more time on the app, it would mostly be there, working on the presentation.
